        <p>So I bet that you think that emperor penguins are just regular penguins and they have black and white feathers.
        But if you think I am wrong here is a quick example of how cool emperor penguins. So if you took an emperor penguin and an average 9-year-old.
        Now put them back to back and they will be the same height! So now do you have a different perspective about emperor penguin?
            Well keep reading!</p>

        <h3 class = "headings">Why Do Penguins Have Wings If They Can't FLy</h3>
        <img class = "wings" src = "wings-of-penguin.png">
        <p>So you are probably wondering why penguins have wings if they can’t fly?
            Well first of all penguins wings are not completely alike to most birds.
            Most bird wings have a slight bend but the wings of a penguin are stiff and straight.
            Also penguin wings are not padded with long feathers but instead are padded with short and smooth feathers.
            But penguins can still fly. But in the WATER! But now let’s learn about how they swim.

    <div id="Swimming" class="tabcontent sideb">
        <h3 class = "headings">Swimming</h3>
        <img class = "penguin-swimming" src = "penguin-swimming.png">
        <p>An emperor penguin is a bird that can not fly but do not get me wrong they are great swimmers.
            Emperor penguins will use their wings as fins instead of using them to fly like other birds.
            When emperor penguins swim they use countershading. Tye have white bellies which make them look like the ocean floor and their black are backs to look like the ocean surface.
            This helps them stay safe from their predators.
            Some of their predators are leopard and fur seals, sea lions, sharks and killer whales.

    <div id="Paris" class="tabcontent sideb">
    <h3 class = "headings">Life Cycle</h3>
        <p>
            <img class = "life-cycle" src = "life-cycle.png" width = "50px">
            The life cycle of an emperor penguin starts with the egg being laid.
            This is most likely to happen in May or June. Next after 65 days the egg hatches.
            Then the dad will go looking for food for 3 months while the mom takes care of the egg.
            Then the egg is sent to a group called creches.
            Then at the age of 19  it is an adult.

        <p>Emperor penguins go in the sea to hunt.
            But something that amazes me is that they go into the sea for around 3 months!!!
            Now you might wonder what they are doing at this time. Well they are collecting food.
            Now this might lead you to the question: what do they eat? Well the answer is krill, fish, squid.
            But sometimes the penguins will senak in a snack or their own while there.
