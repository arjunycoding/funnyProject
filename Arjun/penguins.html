    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    So I bet that you think that emperor penguins are just regular penguins and they have black and white feathers.
    But if you think I am wrong here is a quick example of how cool emperor penguins. So if you took an emperor penguin and an average 9-year-old.
    Now put them back to back and they will be the same height! So now do you have a different perspective about emperor penguin?
    Well keep reading!

<div id="Swimming" class="tabcontent sideb">
    <h3>Swimming</h3>
    <p>An emperor penguin is a bird that can not fly but do not get me wrong they are great swimmers.
        Emperor penguins will use their wings as fins instead of using them to fly like other birds.
        When emperor penguins swim they use countershading. Tye have white bellies which make them look like the ocean floor and their black are backs to look like the ocean surface.
        This helps them stay safe from their predators.
        Some of their predators are leopard and fur seals, sea lions, sharks and killer whales.

    <h3>Life Cycle</h3>
    <p>
        The life cycle of an emperor penguin starts with the egg being laid.
        This is most likely to happen in May or June. Next after 65 days the egg hatches.
        Then the dad will go looking for food for 3 months while the mom takes care of the egg.
        Then the egg is sent to a group called creches.
        Then at the age of 19  it is an adult.
