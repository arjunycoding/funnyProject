    <h2> Lego Beys!!!<h2>

    <h3> By Adhithya Yuvaraj</h3>


        <p>The intro<p>
        <h2 id="Why?"> Why should I know this?</h2>
    <p> If you are a person who knows about beyblades for about a year you would
        probably think "would it be great to make my own bey?" Well,if that is true you have
    come to the right place!</p>
    <h2 id="inside-tip!"> A few tips first...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>First,attack types are horrible to make! They ruin the symertry. Even if your b
        lades are symectraicl it will not work so well.</li>
        <li> When making these they can be big or small,make sure that when you are
        facing an oppent you have almost the same size and power!</li>
        <li> Make sure that some peices don't chip of your top. It might look cool at first
        but soon you're leg will be filled with scratches from legos!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="bigsmalltraning">The Big,Small and Traning tops</h2>
    <p> Their are two types of lego beys Big and small. They both still have about
        the same amount of peices but for the big beys they normally have a
        <strong> wider base</strong> and for the small tops they have well... a small base
    </p><p>Then the training beys are not to big nor to small they help both types. </p>
    <h2> The peices</h2>
    </h3>

    </h3>
        <p> Here are the peices that you should have: A string,A base,A tip and design.
        The string is the thing that holds everything together. It can look like a start shaped
        rod or a black clyinder rod. The base is basically the plate that balences your top.
        It should look circular. Then it is the tip. It helps your top spin. Then the design.
        It makes your top look snazzy!<p?
