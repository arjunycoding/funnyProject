<h2> Lego Beys!!!<h2>
    
<h3> By Adhithya Yuvaraj<h3>
    <p>The intro<p>
    <h2 id="Why?"> Why should I know this?</h2>
<p> If you are a person who knows about beyblades for about a year you would
    probably think "would it be great to make my own bey?" Well,if that is true you have
come to the right place!</p>
<h2 id="inside-tip!"> A few tips first...</h2>
<ul>
    <li>First,attack types are horrible to make! They ruin the symertry. Even if your b
    lades are symectraicl it will not work so well.</li>
    <li> When making these they can be big or small,make sure that when you are
    facing an oppent you have almost the same size and power!</li>
    <li> Make sure that some peices don't chip of your top. It might look cool at first
    but soon you're leg will be filled with scratches from legos!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="bigsmalltraning">The Big,Small and Traning tops</h2>
<p> Their are two types of lego beys Big and small. They both still have about
    the same amount of peices but for the big beys they normally have a
    <strong> wider base</strong> and for the small tops they have well... a small base
</p><p>Then the training beys are not to big nor to small they help both types. </p>
