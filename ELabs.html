        like you throughout the world. Come on with us as we go through the
        makings of eraser clothing,houses and jobs and even money!

        2.One eraser<br>
        3.$1000 eraser dollars.<br>
        4.You also need glue,tape, scissors and markers!<br>

          <h2>Money</h2>
          <p>Eraser money is very important. Fist of all,to represent this
              you use a $ sign. The money is a lot like U.S dollars. Their is a 1,5,10
              ,50,100 and 1000 bill. Their is also a 1,5,10,50,100 and 1000 cent coin.
              Be sure you have a mark to make sure it is official,it should also
              be secret. Eraser money looks
              like this: and coins look like this:</p>




          <h2 id = "Politics">Politics</h2>

          <p>
              Now you might be thinking well did you really cover all the
              jobs well, no. We did not cover the GOVERNMENT.
              Ok so Let’s say you wanted to be the government you after you read
              this article you will find the place to ‘register’ same for the Pres but
              remember that this is a big responsibility.
              Also know that you have to be voted by the people to get into the
              government/be the president.
          </p>


          <p> Every branch has to agree on an act. It should be for the good of the people.</p>
          <p>Their are three people in the government. President,Vice President and
              The Vice of the Vice President. They all work together. They are supposed
              to run and each make a small speech. Then everyone will vote for who they want
              in those three poistions. The top three will be in the government.</p>
      </div>

<div class="info">
    <h2 id="next">What is next?</h2>
    <p>Well you know the basics of the erasers so what is next?
        Start building your communtiy,make the government and add things
        to your eraser house. Sky's the limit of what you can make.</p>
